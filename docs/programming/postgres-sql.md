# Guide For Postgres SQL

## 1. Getting Started

Installing postgresql on macOS (using Homebrew):

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

Then start the service:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

The next command should **fail** for you:

```bash
psql
```

by saying something like:

```
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  database "talkohavy" does not exist
```

That's because installing `postgresql` using brew creates a database named `postgres`.
Now, try running:

```bash
psql postgres
```

and you'll be logged in! ðŸ™‚  
You'll see something like:

```
psql (14.13 (Homebrew))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

Let's list all the available databases to prove postgres is one of them:

```sql
\list
```

or:

```sql
\l
```

for short.

You should see something like:

```
                              List of databases
   Name    |   Owner   | Encoding | Collate | Ctype |    Access privileges
-----------+-----------+----------+---------+-------+-------------------------
 postgres  | talkohavy | UTF8     | C       | C     |
 template0 | talkohavy | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/talkohavy           +
           |           |          |         |       | talkohavy=CTc/talkohavy
 template1 | talkohavy | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/talkohavy           +
           |           |          |         |       | talkohavy=CTc/talkohavy
(3 rows)
```

Let's create a database for your machine name:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE talkohavy;
```

List out your databases again to see that it was actually created:

```sql
\list
```

Now, you should be able to connect to your newly created aaa database with:

```bash
psql talkohavy
```

if the name of your new database is similar to your username, then you can simply type `psql` for short:

```bash
psql
```

Let's create out first table now:

```sql
CREATE TABLE words (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    spelling VARCHAR(255),  -- or use TEXT for longer strings
    score INT CHECK (score >= 0 AND score <= 100)
);
```

Let's add a few records to the new "words" table:

```sql
INSERT INTO words (word, score) VALUES
('Hello world', 10),
('PostgreSQL is great', 20),
('Database management', 30),
('Learning SQL', 40);
```
