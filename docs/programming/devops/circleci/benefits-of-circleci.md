# Benefits of CircleCI

Organizations choose CircleCI because jobs run fast and builds can be optimized for speed. CircleCI can be configured to run very complex pipelines efficiently with sophisticated caching, Docker layer caching, and resource classes for running on faster machines.

As a developer using CircleCI you can:

- SSH into any job to debug your build issues.
- Set up parallelism in your `.circleci/config.yml` file to run test jobs faster.
- Configure caching with two simple keys to reuse data from previous jobs in your workflow.
- Configure self-hosted runners for unique platform support.
- Access Arm VM resources and Arm on Docker.
- Use orbs, reusable packages of configuration, to integrate with third parties.
- Use pre-built Docker images in a variety of languages.
- Use the API to retrieve information about jobs and workflows.
- Use the CLI to access advanced tools locally.
