# Helm Upgrade - Deep Dive

## About

When a new version of a chart is released, or when you want to change the configuration of your release, you can use the `helm upgrade` command.

An upgrade takes an existing release and upgrades it according to the information you provide. Because Kubernetes charts can be large and complex, Helm tries to perform the least invasive upgrade. It will only update things that have changed since the last release.

```bash
helm upgrade -f panda.yaml happy-panda bitnami/wordpress
```
