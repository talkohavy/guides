# SOLID

<font size="4">An acronym for <strong>5 design principles</strong> in software engineering.</font>

## - `Definition`  

In software engineering, SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.  

<br/>

## - `Breakdown of the Acronym`

|Letter|Meaning|
|:---:|:---|
|**<font size="6"><span style={{color: 'red'}}>S</span></font>**|The **Single Responsibility** principle says that _Every class should have only one responsibility_.|
|**<font size="6"><span style={{color: 'red'}}>O</span></font>**|The **Open-Closed** principle says that _Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification_.|
|**<font size="6"><span style={{color: 'red'}}>L</span></font>**|The **Liskov Substitution** principle says that _Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it_. See also [design by contract](/docs/programming/concepts/design-by-contract "Go to Design by Contract guide").|
|**<font size="6"><span style={{color: 'red'}}>I</span></font>**|The **Interface Segregation** principle says that _Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use_".|
|**<font size="6"><span style={{color: 'red'}}>D</span></font>**|The **Dependency Inversion** principle instructs you to _Depend upon abstractions, not concretions_.|




Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.
